## Why interactivity

- Cool, but NOT always necessary
- Journals still don't accept it
- 

## Problem

- Images Rendering is slow
- Manipulate package!
- Problem is Image
- too much backend
- Use JS that already exists
 

## What is an image

- 3-dimensional array

## Lessons Learned

- Use other people's stuff
- Porting to R can help a communithy
    - not always so straightforward
    - Functionality at the whim of the maintainer
    - not std R
- htmlwidgets is great
    - not always super easy for a user to cram into
